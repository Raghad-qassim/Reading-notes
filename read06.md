}

 }

# CSS
The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.
CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.


CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts:**selector and a declaration**

CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: **a property and a value**

***css can be external or internal***

***external css***

The <link> element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page.

**some type of selector**
- Universal Selector (  *{} )
- Type Selector (h1, h2, h3 {})
- Class Selector (.note {})
- ID Selector (#introduction {})
