# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

**studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems.**

**What interested the researchers most, however, was that teams that did well on one assignment usually did well on all the others.**

**The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another**

**good teams behaviors**

 1) equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking

 2)good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’

 **conversational turn-taking’’ and ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ as aspects of what’s known as psychological safety**

 **establishing psychological safety is, by its very nature, somewhat messy and difficult to implement**

# Transform

1) 2D Transform

Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes.

**2D Rotate**

The rotate value provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees.

**2D Scale**

allows you to change the appeared size of an element

**2D Translate**

translateX value will change the position of an element on the horizontal axis while using the translateY value will change the position of an element on the vertical axis.

**2D Skew**

Using the skewX value distorts an element on the horizontal axis while the skewY value distorts an element on the vertical axis.

2)Combining Transforms

 In this event multiple transforms can be combined together. 

3) 3D Transform
Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis. 

**3D Rotate**

With three-dimensional transforms we can rotate an element around any axes. To do so, we use three new transform values, including rotateX, rotateY, and rotateZ.

**3D Scale**

By using the scaleZ three-dimensional transform elements may be scaled on the z axis.

**3D Translate**

Elements may also be translated on the z axis using the translateZ value

**3D Skew**

Elements may be skewed on the x and y axis, then transformed three-dimensionally as wished, but they cannot be skewed on the z axis.

# Transitions & Animations

 transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state.

 There are four transition related properties in total, including:

 1) transition-property

 property determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties

 2) transition-duration

 The value of this property can be set using general timing values, including seconds (s) and milliseconds (ms).

 3) transition-timing-function

 used to set the speed in which a transition will move

 4)transition-delay. 

 duration, and timing function, you can also set a delay with the transition-delay property.


 **Animations**

To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the @keyframes rule

(animation-name )property is used with the animation name, identified from the @keyframes rule, as the property value

(animation-duration )property and value so that the browser knows how long an animation should take to complete.

(animation-iteration)-count property may be used. Values for the animation-iteration-count property include either an integer or the infinite keyword.

(nimation-fill-mode )property identifies how an element should be styled either before, after, or before and after an animation is run.

 **Here are 8 really simple effects that will add life to your UI and smiles to your users’ faces.**

 1)Fade in

 Fade in effects are coded in two steps: first, you set the initial state; next, you set the change

 2)Change color

 3)Grow & Shrink

To grow an element, you used to have to use its width and height, or its padding.

4)Rotate elements

5)Square to circle

popular effect at the moment is transitioning a square element into a round one, and vice versa

6)3D shadow

7)Swing

8)Inset border
