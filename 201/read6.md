 **Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps:**

1: Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.

2: Use its text content, child elements, and attributes. 

*DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist,
which is a collection of nodes.*

**Method that return a single element node :**

1-getElementByld( 'id' )

2-querySel ector( ' css selector')

**Method that return a one or more element :**

1-getEl ementsByClassName( ' class ' )

2-getEl ementsByTagName( ' tagName ' )

3-querySelectorAll ( 'css select or')
