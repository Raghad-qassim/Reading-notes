# Charts JS

charts better for displaying data visually than tables.
They are easier to look at and convey data quickly.

Type of chart:

1)line chart

Steps to draw a line chart:

1) we need to do is create a canvas element in HTML

2) we need to write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas, so add this to the foot of your body element.
