**Introduction**

people can access to the web site using:

1- Browsers

People access websites using software called a web browser
 examples include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Opera.
You can view a web page, by typing a web address into their browser, follow a link from another site, or use a bookmark.

2-Web server

a web server which hosts the website.
Web servers are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet.

3- Screen reader

Screen readers are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user.

4-Devices

Example:
desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones

**All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.**

How to access to the web page for example (google.com)

1- you must connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP).

2- you type a domain name or web address into your browser to visit a site.

3- Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers.

4- The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested (google .com).

5- The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.
IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods / full stops.

# Chapter(1)

The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets — these are called HTML elements.

 Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag.

Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element
They made up of two parts: a name and a value.

Some content management systems (CMS)offer tools that also allow you to edit the template files.

# Chapter (8)

Versions of HTML:
1)HTML 4 (Released 1997)
With the exception of a few elements added in HTML5.

2)XHTML 1.0(Released 2000)
Its purpose was to allow people to write new markup languages.
main flavors of XHTML 1.0 were created: 
	Strict XHTML 1.0, where authors had to follow the rules to the letter 

	Transitional XHTML 1.0, where authors could still use presentational 

	XHTML 1.0 Frameset, which allowed web page authors to partition a browser window into several "frames

3)HTML5(Released 2000)
 web page authors do not need to close all tags, and new elements and attributes will be introduced.
1)DOCTYPE
Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page.
2)<- -        - - !>

If you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser
3)ID attribute
very HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.
4)Class attribute
Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute.

5)Block elements
Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. 
Examples of block elements
1)p
2) li
3) ul

6)Inline elements
Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighboring elements.
 Example
1)A
2)Img


7)Grouping text and elements in a block

div
    The element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
8)Grouping text and elements inline
The span element acts like an inline equivalent of the div.

It is used to either:
1- Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text.
2- Contain a number of inline elements.

9)You will usually see that a class or id attribute is used with elements:
 ● To explain the purpose of this element 
● So that CSS styles can be applied to elements that have specific values for these attributes.

10)Iframe
An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page.
There are a few attributes that you will need to know to use it: 
Src
  Height
  width 
 Scrolling
Frameborder
Seamless

11)Meta
The meta element lives inside the element and contains information about that web page.
The meta element is an empty element so it does not have a closing tag. It uses attributes to carry the information.
The value of the name attribute can be anything you want it to be. Some defined values for this attribute that are commonly used are:
1)description
2) keywords
3) robots

12)escape character
There are some characters that are used in and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the left and right angled brackets.)


# Chapter (17)

New html5 layout elements 

1)The header and footer
The header and footer elements can be used for: 
● The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site. 
● A header or footer for an individual or within the page.

2)Navigation
used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

3)Articles
acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
       
4)Asides
has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an article element or not.

5)Sections
groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

6)Heading group
The purpose of this element is to group together a set of one or more h1 through h6 elements.

7)Figures

It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images).

8)Sectioning elements 
 Div element will remain an important way to group together related elements.

9)Linking Around Block-Level Elements
HTML5 allows web page authors to place an  a  element around a block level element that contains child elements.

10)Helping Older Browsers Understand
Older browsers that do not know the new HTML5 elements will automatically treat them as inline elements.

# Chapter (18)

Every website should be designed for the target audience which can be :

1-individuals

2-Companies

-To help determine why people are coming to your website, there are two basic categories of questions you can ask:

 1: The first attempts to discover the underlying motivations for why visitors come to the site.

 2: The second examines the specific goals of the visitors. These are the triggers making them come to the site now.

People visit website to get :

1- Goods / Services

2- information


**site map:**

create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site.

**card sorting:**

help to decide what information should go on each page.

**Wireframe:**

 simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site.

**Visual hierarchy:**

 refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being displayed.

**grouping and Similarity:**

Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend

**Grouping types:**

1- Proximity

2- Closure

3- Continuance

4- White Space

5- color

6- Borders


**Designing Navigation**

Good navigation tends to follow these principles:

1- Concise

2- Clear

3- Selective

4- Context

5- Interactive

6- Consistent

# JAVA SCRIPT

**What is the script:**

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

**How to write a script:**

To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

**Writing a script steps:**
1- define the goal

2- design the script

3- code each step

*Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations. You can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together. The flowcharts show the paths between each step.*

Computers create models of the world using data.

*Objects(things)*

In computer programming, each physical thing in the world can be represented as an object
Each object can have its own: 

1- Properties 

2- Events

3- Method

*Properties (characteristics)*

Each property has a name and a value, and each of these name/value pairs tells you something about each individual instance of the object.

*Event:*

There are common ways in which people interact with each type of object
Methods
Methods represent things people need to do with objects. They can retrieve or update the values of an object's properties.

Web browsers are programs built using objects:

1)window object
The browser represents each window or tab using a window object.

2)document object
The current web page loaded into each window is modelled using a document object.

**HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER**

1)HTML

Content layer

2)CSS

Presentation layer

3) JavaScript
Behavior layer

**progressive enhancement**
These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages
