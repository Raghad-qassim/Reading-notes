# chapter 4: 

**Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.**

*Directories*
placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder

*Relative URLs*

can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.

Relative Link Type:

1-Same Folder

2-Child Folder

3-Grandchild Folder

4-Parent Folder

5-GrandParent Folder

*target*
If you want a link to open in a new window.

# Chapter(15):

*Building Blocks*

CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

1-block-level box

start on a new line

2-inline box

flow in between surrounding text

*containing or parent element.*

If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box

*CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page:*

1-normal flow
2- relative positioning
3-absolute positioning

**box offset:**

 properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.

**Fixed Positioning:**

 This is a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element.

**Floating an element:**

 allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box

**normal Flow**

   In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one

**Positioning**

1- Relative

2- absolute

3-fixed

**The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.**


*Clearing Floats:*

. It can take the following values:

1-left

2-right

3-both

4-none

**screen Sizes**

Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

**Screen Resolution**

refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch

*layouts*

1- Fixed Width

2- Liquid

*Layout Grids*

Composition in any visual art (such as design, painting, or photography) is the placement or arrangement of visual elements — how they are organized on a page


*CSS Frameworks*

aim to make your life easier by providing the code for common tasks, such as creating layout grids, styling forms, creating printer-friendly versions of pages and so on

# JS book:

**Chapter 3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects”**

**function**

series of statements together to perform a specific task.

**function declaration**

 creates a function that you can call later in your code. 

**function expression.**

    If you put a function where the interpreter would expect to see an expression, then it is treated as an     expression.

**Immediately invoked function expressions**

Pronounced "iffy," these functions are not given a name. Instead, they are executed once as the interpreter comes across them.

**variable  scope**

The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used within your code.

1-local variable

When a variable is created inside a function using the var keyword.

2-global variable

you create a variable outside of a function, then it can be used anywhere within the script.
**Global variables use more memory. The browser has to remember them for as long as the web page using them is loaded. Local variables are only remembered during the period of time that a function is being executed.**

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

**How does pair programming work?**
pair programming commonly involves two roles:

1- Driver 
is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. 

2-Navigator

 uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. 

**Why pair program?**
There are four fundamental skills that help anyone learn a new language:

 Listening: hearing and interpreting the vocabulary 

Speaking: using the correct words to communicate an idea

 Reading: understanding what written language intends to convey 

Writing: producing from scratch a meaningful

**Pair programming touches on all four skills**

 Benefits of pair programming:

1.Greater efficiency

2.Engaged collaboration

3.Learning from fellow 

4.Social skills

5.Job interview readiness

6.Work environment readiness
